music-sync

A set of scripts to archive all my mp3 files and serve them as static content on port 8000.

There are other ways to accomplish moving files around between devices but this is the easiest for me - I can setup cron jobs to make sure the server is running and the archive is up to date.

Note:

music-sync.py requires setproctitle, provided by package python3-setproctitle
